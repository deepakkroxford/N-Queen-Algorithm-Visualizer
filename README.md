# N-Queen-Algorithm-Visualizer
N-Queen Visualizer

This project is a visual representation of the N-Queen problem implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The N-Queen problem involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

Features

	•	Interactive Visualization: Watch the algorithm solve the N-Queen problem in real-time.
	•	Customizable Board Size: Adjust the size of the chessboard to see how the algorithm handles different values of N.
	•	User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive design for an enhanced user experience.

** Installation **

1.	Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n-queen-visualizer.git

2.	Navigate to the project directory:
      cd n-queen-visualizer

3. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to run the visualizer.

Usage

	1.	Open the index.html file in your browser.
	2.	Enter the desired board size (N) in the input field.
	3.	Click the “Start Visualization” button to see the algorithm in action.

How It Works ?

The N-Queen Visualizer uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution to the N-Queen problem. Here’s a brief overview of the algorithm:

	1.	Place a queen in the first column.
	2.	Move to the next column and try placing a queen in a safe position.
	3.	If a safe position is found, place the queen and move to the next column.
	4.	If no safe position is found, backtrack to the previous column and move the queen to the next safe position.
	5.	Repeat the process until all queens are placed on the board or all possibilities are exhausted.

Technologies Used

	•	JavaScript: For implementing the N-Queen solving algorithm and handling user interactions.
	•	HTML: For structuring the web page.
	•	CSS: For styling the visualizer and making it look appealing.
